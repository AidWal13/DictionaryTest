## For those who have played No Man's Sky:
I built this calculator to help myself better understand how close I was to building some of the most valuable trade goods in the game.  Whether it's just a few Aronium, or making a Stasis Device, I wanted an interface that could tell me if all the ingredients in my inventory were enough to build what I was looking for.  I hope this helps you as well. 

## For those who haven't played No Man's Sky:
In the video game "No Man's Sky," there are valuable items that you can create and sell for a great deal of in-game currency.  Some of these items only require two base components to create, and in turn aren't worth very much.  Others require building a complex pyramid of other items that build other items that build other items, and so on, eventually leading to creating the most expensive craftable item in the game: the Stasis Device. I made this calculator to help players navigate this complex web of craftables so that they can input what they have, and the calculator will let them know how much they still need, or if they have enough to build their desired item(s).
